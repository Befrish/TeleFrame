# Contributing

TeleFrame uses [git-flow] with default options.
To contribute, please follow these rules:

* A develop branch is created from master
* A release branch is created from develop
* Feature branches are created from develop
* When a feature is complete it is merged into the develop branch
* When the release branch is done it is merged into develop and master
* If an issue in master is detected a hotfix branch is created from master
* Once the hotfix is complete it is merged to both develop and master

A graphical overview of the git-flow workflow can be found [here](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/)
